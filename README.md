# WikiQuery: Information Retrieval with Precision and Ease

WikiQuery is a specialized platform designed to streamline information retrieval for users interested in digital currencies. It provides precise responses to user queries related to digital currencies by integrating a vector database and a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Introduction

In the era of big data and rapidly evolving information landscapes, traditional search systems face limitations, especially when seeking specific answers on platforms like Wikipedia. WikiQuery addresses this challenge by offering a novel solution to enhance the search experience for users interested in digital currencies.

## Features

- **Querying**: Users can query cryptocurrency topics via typing or voice commands.
- **Results Display**: Answers are displayed to the user in a structured format for easy navigation and exploration.

## Development

WikiQuery was developed using a combination of technologies including Python, FastAPI, React.js, and various NLP frameworks. The key components of its development include:
- Knowledge base collection and preprocessing
- Document creation and embedding generation
- Vector database integration
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline development
- Web application development for both front-end and back-end

## Evaluation

An evaluation of the RAG application was conducted to ensure accurate and reliable answers. The evaluation process included assessing the performance of various components such as the Generator and Retriever, using metrics like fact-checking and semantic similarity.

## Usage

To use WikiQuery, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the web application using `python app.py`.
4. Access the application through your web browser.

## Future Work

Potential future enhancements for WikiQuery include:
- Expansion to cover additional topics beyond cryptocurrency.
- Integration of user feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.
- Optimization of performance and scalability.
- Enhancement of the user interface for improved usability and accessibility.
